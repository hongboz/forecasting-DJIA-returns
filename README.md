# forecasting-DJIA-returns

This is a  time series analysis project I did in R markdown for the course STA457. The objective was to forecast the Dow Jones Industrial Average monthly excess return for March and April, 2020 as accurately as possible using the monthly excess returns from January 2000 to February 2020.
